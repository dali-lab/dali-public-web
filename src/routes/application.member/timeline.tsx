            <p>We are now conducting applications in an annual cycle as opposed to a termly cycle. This means that the next application cycle will likely open up 25F and close during 26W.</p>
            <p>Be sure to budget enough time for yourself to complete the application! Try to start the application at least a week in advance to give yourself ample amounts of time for the supplements.</p>
